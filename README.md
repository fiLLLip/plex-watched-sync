# Plex Watched Sync
Synchronize watched status between Plex Media Servers. Ready to use! Very convenient if you have access to several Plex Media Servers and use wathed status actively to track your tv-series progress. Already have an instance of the server running, to ease use. See detailed desciption.

This is my first Python project, so be nice :)
 
###Collaboration
Feel free to contribute!

###Roadmap
* Frontend to ease authentication between account and plex.tv
* Deploy server on cloud VPS
* Refactor

##Server
The server application is based on Falcon web framework ( https://falconframework.org/ ), and running with Redis as the datastore.

###Requirements
* Python >=2.7
* Redis
* Requests
* Falcon
* Gunicorn (or another server for running Falcon)

###Installation
```pip install redis requests falcon gunicorn gevent```

If Redis is installed and running, you can run the server when located in the server folder with ```gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 serve:app```

###Security
There is an endpoint to "log in" with a plex user account, to add it to the system and authorize server access to it. 
First, you need to get an authorization token from plex. You can do that by editing the username and password and running this cURL:
```
curl -X POST -H "X-Plex-Product: WatchStateSync" -H "X-Plex-Version: 0.1" -H "X-Plex-Client-Identifier: WatchStateSync" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW" -F "user[login]=<username>" -F "user[password]=<password>" "https://plex.tv/users/sign_in.json"
```
From the response, copy the authorizationToken and use it in the following cURL:
```
curl -X POST -H "X-token: <token>" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" "http://plexsync.filllip.net:8080/api/user/login"
```
Now your user is added to the system and all servers you have access to is authorized to read and update your watched data.

##Client
Runs on the same machine as the Plex Media Server. Copy the props.py.sample and rename to props.py. Invoke the script via a cron job. Every minute is often enough.
###Config
**BASE_URL**
Server url without trailing slash. There is already an instance running at http://plexsync.filllip.net:8080/api/. Feel free to use.

**SERVER_ID**
Log into plex.tv and find "machineIdentifier" for your server at https://plex.tv/pms/servers.xml

**DB_PATH**
Path to Plex DB

**ADMIN_ACCOUNT_REAL_ID**
In local Plex DB the admins account ID is 1 (most likely your account). Log into plex.tv and find your account ID at https://plex.tv/users/account

###Requirements
* Python >=2.7
* SQLite3
* Requests

###Installation
```pip install requests sqlite3```

Set up the property file, then add to crontab:
```
*/30 * * * * /usr/bin/python /root/plex-watched-sync/client/sync.py > /var/log/plexsync-cron.log
```
Now wait and enjoy.
